# Advanced Navigator

A Flutter Navigator which combines the capabilities of the [new Declarative](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q0jx0l4-xymph9O6zLaOY4d_f7YFpNWX_eGbzYxr9wY/edit#) and the existing Imperative Navigator API into one easy-to-use widget. This widget implements the new Router widget wrapped around a Navigator to allow for full stack manipulation operations, URL synchronization with browsers and better nesting. All endpoints of the Imperative API (i.e. push, pushNamed, pushPopUntil, etc.) continue to work under this widget.
